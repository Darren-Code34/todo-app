## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With the TODO APP i learned how to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.
In addition to creating tasks, I've coded:
- A system for changing modes (light/dark mode);
- An information bar showing the number of tasks remaining;
- A filter that sorts tasks according to their status.
I also learned how to code a drag-and-drop system.




### Continued development

even though I've learnt how to code a drag and drop system, I haven't managed to integrate it into the application, so I'd like to learn more about this feature.
